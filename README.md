Expense tracking system is designed to help users keep a close eye on their finances by offering an intuitive platform for logging expenses, setting and monitoring budgets, and tracking progress toward savings goals.
The primary goal of Expense tracking system is to give users a better understanding of their spending habits.
By logging each expense, users can categorize their purchases, allowing them to see exactly where their money is going. 
These categories could include essentials like groceries, transportation, and utilities, as well as discretionary spending like dining out or entertainment.
Having this information organized and visualized in one place helps users quickly identify where they may be overspending or where they can cut back.
Such insights are invaluable for those looking to adjust their financial habits and work towards a more balanced budget.
Expense tracking system is a project driven by the financial challenges students commonly face as they navigate budgeting and financial independence.
For many students, managing money is a new responsibility that can seem overwhelming, particularly when balancing tight budgets and competing expenses.
It’s designed to be an educational and practical tool that empowers students to take control of their finances and build lifelong financial skills.
